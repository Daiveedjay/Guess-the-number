Here's how the game goes.
1)You have to guess the randomly generated number under 7 tries.

2)For each failed attempt, a red screen is displayed with a failed message of how close or far you are from the correct number.

3)If you're succesful, a green screen is displayed, the number of attempts in which you took
gets subtracted from 7 and the difference is displayed as your highscore.

4)If subsequents attempt highscores are higher than the current one, the newer highscore replaces the old one.

5)If you take more than 7 attempts without winning, you lose the game and have to restart the game.
